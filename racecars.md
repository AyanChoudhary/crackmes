## Decompiler: Ghidra

Okay so it took me some to figure this out but I got there eventually. So the program on decompilation gives that it is checking the characters of the given argument, which in this case is the file name itself(I thought we had to supply a separate argument :P).

The program checks whether the file name is an anagram(i.e the word is spelt the same way if read from either side).

## Solution

Change the name of the file to an anagram :) for eg. ```./racecar```
